# ServiApp
An idea i had for an app where anyone can signup and post tasks he wants accomplished
The user posts a task and any other logged in user can view this task and indicate an interest by selecting the task which allows him/her to message the task uploader in form of a chat activity.Task uploader would see users interested interested in solving the task  in a list which he can then message and solve his/her problem.
